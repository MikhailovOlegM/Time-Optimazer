1. Decide on the task to be done.  
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).  
3. Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.  
4. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.  
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3â€“5 minutes), then go to step 2.
